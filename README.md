# Linked List

### Implement a Linked List to store a list of objects.

Linked Lists use up more memory than arrays, but are more flexible. 
Elements can be added in middle, the size can be changed, etc.

Each element is wrapped in a Node which contains the element and a link to the next node. 
(The LinkedList itself is really just a link to the first node.)

### Instructions

Created a doubly linked list, this means each Node has a next and previous element.

Implemented Node as a nested class since it is only used by LinkedList. 
This means the class definition for Node is inside LinkedList instead of in its own file.

Run the tests to ensure LinkedList is implemented correctly.
